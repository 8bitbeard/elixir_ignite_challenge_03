## Elixir Ignite Challenge #02

This project was made to fulfill the third challenge on the Rocketseat Ignite Elixir course challenge.

The challenge was to implement report generator, which receives a csv file, and returns a map with the parsed data.

A template repository was given with the unit tests already written, and make this tests pass was part of the challenge.

To run this code first you need to install all the dependencies with `mix deps.get`, then you can run the tests with `mix test`
